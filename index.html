        <h2>Ballet Shoes</h2>
        <p>Here are leather ballet shoes. Feet shown in fifth position! A ballet shoe, or ballet slipper, is a lightweight shoe designed specifically for ballet dancing. It may be made from soft leather, canvas, or satin, and has flexible, thin full or split soles. Traditionally, women wear pink shoes and men wear white or black shoes. Skin colored slippers—which are unobtrusive and thus give the appearance of dancing barefoot—are worn in modern ballets and sometimes modern dancing by both men and women.

        <p>This is a traditional Galesh shoe. A kalash' or galesh (گالش) is a traditional footwear of Iran. The Kurdish cotton kalash is particularly famous in Marivan. Unlike most galoshes, the "galesh" are always handwoven and with specific fabrics.

Galesh are still made today, but in the category of handicrafts and cultural produce.

        <h2>Sandal</h2>
        <p>These are some fancy sandals! Sandals are an open type of footwear, consisting of a sole held to the wearer's foot by straps going over the instep and around the ankle. Sandals can also have a heel. While the distinction between sandals and other types of footwear can sometimes be blurry (as in the case of huaraches—the woven leather footwear seen in Mexico, and peep-toe pumps), the common understanding is that a sandal leaves all or most of the foot exposed. People may choose to wear sandals for several reasons, among them comfort in warm weather, economy (sandals tend to require less material than shoes and are usually easier to construct), and as a fashion choice.</p>
